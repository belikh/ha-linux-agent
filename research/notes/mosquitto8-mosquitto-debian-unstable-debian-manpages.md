  Caveat: issue #3726 (Aug 2026) documents that mosquitto(8)''s /broker/mqtt/* sub-tree
  listing is partly wrong — sys_tree.c never publishes those; the publish/messages/dropped

  mqtt/* variants listed in the man page should not be relied on.'

MOSQUITTO(8)

NAME¶

mosquitto - an MQTT broker

SYNOPSIS¶

mosquitto [-c config file]
[-d | --daemon] [-p port number]
[-q] [-v] [--tls-keylog file]

DESCRIPTION¶

mosquitto is a broker for the MQTT protocol version
5.0/3.1.1/3.1.

It is part of the overall mosquitto project. See
mosquitto(7) for an overview of all man pages.

OPTIONS¶

-c, --config-file

Load configuration from a file. If not given, then the
broker will listen on port 1883 bound to the loopback interface, and the
default values as described in mosquitto.conf(5) are used.

Important

See the -p option for a description of changes in behaviour from 1.6.x to
2.0.

-d, --daemon

Run mosquitto in the background as a daemon. All
other behaviour remains the same.

-p, --port

Listen on the port specified. May be specified up to 10
times to open multiple sockets listening on different ports.

Important

In version 1.6.x and earlier, the listener defined by -p (or the default
port of 1883) would be bound to all interfaces and so be accessible from any
network. It could also be used in combination with -c.

From version 2.0 onwards, the listeners defined with -p are
bound to the loopback interface only, and so can only be connected to from
the local machine. If both -p is used and a listener is defined in a
configuration file, then the -p options are IGNORED.

-q, --quiet

Available from version 2.1.

Disable all logging. This is equivalent to setting log_type
to none in the configuration file. This overrides any logging options
given in the configuration file and also overrides --verbose.

--test-config

Available from version 2.1.

Load the config file specified with -c, and verify that it
is valid but do not start the broker. The broker exit code will be 0 if the
config was valid, or non-zero if no config file was specified or the config
file was invalid.

--tls-keylog file

Available from version 2.1.

Log TLS connection information to file. This option allows
tools such as tcpdump, wireshark and mqttshark to
decrypt TLS traffic and inspect the MQTT traffic. In Wireshark this can be
done by setting the (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename option for the
Transport Layer Security protocol.

This option should be used for debugging only, it must not be used
in production.

-v, --verbose

Use verbose logging. This is equivalent to setting
log_type to all in the configuration file. This overrides any
logging options given in the configuration file.

CONFIGURATION¶

The broker can be configured using a configuration file as
described in mosquitto.conf(5) and this is the main point of
information for mosquitto. The files required for SSL/TLS support are
described in mosquitto-tls(7).

PLATFORM LIMITATIONS¶

Some versions of Windows have limitations on the number of
concurrent connections due to the Windows API being used. In modern versions
of Windows, e.g. Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019, this is approximately
8192 connections. In earlier versions of Windows, this limit is 2048
connections.

MQTT SUPPORT¶

Mosquitto supports MQTT v5.0, v3.1.1, and v3.1.

MQTT v5.0¶

Mosquitto provides full MQTT v5.0 support, but some features are
not used directly. The following sections describe the new features and
explain where Mosquitto does not make use of a feature.

Features

Enhanced authentication

Basic MQTT authentication uses username/password checks.
Enhanced authentication allows different authentication schemes to be
integrated into MQTT, and even those schemes with multiple step processes.
Clients request a particular type of authentication and if the broker is
configured for that scheme the authentication continues. Mosquitto supports
enhanced authentication through plugins.

Error handling

Most MQTT packets now have the concept of a reason
code which indicates success or failure, and what the failure was.
Mosquitto provides full support for reason codes, but does not make use of the
reason string feature which can be used to provide a human readable
error string to explain the reason code.

Flow control

The number of "in flight" messages for QoS 1
and QoS 2 can be controlled by both the client and the broker.

Request / response

MQTT v5.0 adds a request/response pattern that allows a
client to publish a message and instruct the subscribers of that message where
to publish a response.

Server redirection

Server redirection is the concept of telling a client to
connect to a different MQTT broker, either on CONNECT or with a broker
initiated DISCONNECT. Mosquitto does not currently make use of this
feature.

Shared subscriptions

When multiple clients subscribe to the same shared
subscription, only one client out of the group will receive each message which
allows for distributing work loads.

Packet properties

MQTT v5.0 allows properties to be added to packets to control
certain behaviour. Unless noted, Mosquitto support the properties listed
below.

CONNECT

•Authentication data

•Authentication method

•Maximum packet size

•Receive maximum

•Request problem information - supported but not
used

MQTT v3.1.1¶

Mosquitto provides full MQTT v3.1.1 support.

MQTT v3.1¶

Mosquitto provides full MQTT v3.1 support.

MQTT v3¶

MQTT v3 is an obsolete version of the protocol that does not
support username/password authentication and used the clean start
flag in the CONNECT packet which applied only to the start of a session. An
MQTT v3 client will be able to successfully connect to a Mosquitto instance
that does not require authentication.

BROKER STATUS¶

Clients can find information about the broker by subscribing to
topics in the $SYS hierarchy as follows. Topics marked as static are only
sent once per client on subscription. All other topics are updated every
sys_interval seconds. If sys_interval is 0, then updates are
not sent.

Note that if you are using a command line client to interact with
the $SYS topics and your shell interprets $ as an environment variable, you
need to place the topic in single quotes '$SYS/...' or to escape the dollar
symbol: \$SYS/... otherwise the $SYS will be treated as an environment
variable.

$SYS/broker/bytes/received

The total number of bytes received since the broker
started.

$SYS/broker/bytes/sent

When bridges are configured to/from the broker, common
practice is to provide a status topic that indicates the state of the
connection. This is provided within $SYS/broker/connection/ by default. If the
value of the topic is 1 the connection is active, if 0 then it is not active.

WILDCARD TOPIC SUBSCRIPTIONS¶

In addition to allowing clients to subscribe to specific topics,
mosquitto also allows the use of two wildcards in subscriptions. + is
the wildcard used to match a single level of hierarchy. For example, for a
topic of "a/b/c/d", the following example subscriptions will
match:

•a/b/c/d

•+/b/c/d

•a/+/c/d

•a/+/+/d

•+/+/+/+

The following subscriptions will not match:

•a/b/c

•b/+/c/d

•+/+/+

The second wildcard is # and is used to match all
subsequent levels of hierarchy. With a topic of "a/b/c/d", the
following example subscriptions will match:

•a/b/c/d

•#

•a/#

•a/b/#

•a/b/c/#

•+/b/c/#

The $SYS hierarchy does not match a subscription of "#".
If you want to observe the entire $SYS hierarchy, subscribe to $SYS/#.

Note that the wildcards must be only ever used on their own, so a
subscription of "a/b+/c" is not valid use of a wildcard. The
# wildcard must only ever be used as the final character of a
subscription.

BRIDGES¶

Multiple brokers can be connected together with the bridging
functionality. This is useful where it is desirable to share information
between locations, but where not all of the information needs to be shared.
An example could be where a number of users are running a broker to help
record power usage and for a number of other reasons. The power usage could
be shared through bridging all of the user brokers to a common broker,
allowing the power usage of all users to be collected and compared. The
other information would remain local to each broker.

For information on configuring bridges, see
mosquitto.conf(5).

SIGNALS¶

On POSIX systems Mosquitto can receive signals and act on them as
described below. To send signals, use e.g. kill -HUP <process id of
mosquitto>

SIGHUP

Upon receiving the SIGHUP signal, mosquitto will attempt
to reload configuration file data, assuming that the -c argument was
provided when mosquitto was started. Not all configuration parameters can be
reloaded without restarting. See mosquitto.conf(5) for details.

If TLS certificates are in use, then mosquitto will also reload
certificate on receiving a SIGHUP.

The logs will also be closed and reopened.

SIGRTMIN

Upon receiving the SIGRTMIN signal, mosquitto will close
and reopen the logs to support log rotation.

SIGUSR1

Upon receiving the SIGUSR1 signal, mosquitto will write
the persistence database to disk. This signal is only acted upon if
persistence is enabled.

SIGUSR2

The SIGUSR2 signal causes mosquitto to print out the
current subscription tree, along with information about where retained
messages exist. This is intended as a testing feature only and may be removed
at any time.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES¶

MOSQUITTO_UNSAFE_ALLOW_SYMLINKS

By default, sensitive file with a path including a
symbolic link will be refused to be loaded. Set this environment variable to
any value to allow load files through symbolic links. Note that making use of
this variable could expose you to symlink attacks and so it should only be
used in cases where you are absolutely sure this is not a risk.

FILES¶

/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

Configuration file. See mosquitto.conf(5).

/var/lib/mosquitto/mosquitto.db

Persistent message data storage location if persist
enabled.

/etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.deny

Host access control via tcp-wrappers as described in
hosts_access(5).

THANKS¶

Thanks to Andy Stanford-Clark for being one of the people who came
up with MQTT in the first place. Thanks to Andy and Nicholas O'Leary for
providing clarifications of the protocol.

Thanks also to everybody at the Ubuntu UK Podcast and Linux
Outlaws for organising OggCamp, where Andy gave a talk that inspired
mosquitto.
