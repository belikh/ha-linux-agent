Tailscale CLI
Last validated: Jul 30, 2026|Copy as Markdown|View as Markdown

The Tailscale client includes a built-in command-line interface (CLI) you can use to manage and troubleshoot your device within your Tailscale network (known as a tailnet).

The Tailscale CLI is available for all plans.

Using the Tailscale CLI

The location of the CLI varies depending on your platform:

LinuxmacOSWindows

On Linux, the CLI is your primary interface to Tailscale. The tailscale binary is likely already in your $PATH, so you can run commands with:

tailscale <command>

There is no CLI support for iOS and Android.

Tab completion

The Tailscale CLI supports tab-completion for commands, flags, and arguments. You can configure tab-completion with the completion command.

tailscale completion <shell> [--flags] [--descs]

Select your shell, then follow the instructions to load Tailscale CLI completions.

BashZshFishPowerShell

To load tab-completions for Bash, run the following command.

source <(tailscale completion bash)

Run the following command to load completions for every new session on Linux, then reload your shell.

tailscale completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/tailscale

Run the following command to load completions for every new session on macOS, then reload your shell.

tailscale completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/tailscale

Command Reference

Common flags for all commands:

--socket=<path> Path to the tailscaled socket.

up

Connect your device to Tailscale and authenticate if needed.

tailscale up [flags]

Running tailscale up without any flags connects to Tailscale.

Common flags:

--accept-routes Accept subnet routes that other nodes advertise. The default depends on the host operating system. For certain platforms - Windows, iOS, Android, the macOS App Store variant, and the macOS standalone variant - the default is to accept routes. All other platforms default to not accepting routes.

--advertise-exit-node Offer to be an exit node for outbound internet traffic from the Tailscale network. Defaults to not offering to be an exit node.

--advertise-routes=<ip> Expose physical subnet routes to your entire Tailscale network.

--exit-node=<ip|name> Provide a Tailscale IP or machine name to use as an exit node. To disable the use of an exit node, pass the flag with an empty argument: --exit-node=.

--exit-node-allow-lan-access Allow the client node access to its own LAN while connected to an exit node. Defaults to not allowing access while connected to an exit node.

--force-reauth Force re-authentication.

--snat-subnet-routes (Linux only) Disable source NAT. In normal operations, a subnet device sees the traffic originating from the subnet router. This simplifies routing, but does not allow traversing multiple networks. By disabling source NAT, the end machine sees the LAN IP address of the originating machine as the source.

--stateful-filtering Enable stateful filtering for subnet routers and exit nodes. When enabled, inbound packets with another node's destination IP are dropped, unless they are a part of a tracked outbound connection from that node. Defaults to disabled.

--shields-up Block incoming connections from other devices on your Tailscale network. Useful for personal devices that only make outgoing connections.

--ssh Run a Tailscale SSH server, permitting access per the tailnet administrator's declared access policy, or the default policy if none is defined. Defaults to false.

For a complete list of available flags, refer to the tailscale up topic.

down

Disconnect from Tailscale. Running this command is the same as choosing to disconnect from or quit a Tailscale client.

tailscale down

When disconnected, you cannot reach devices over Tailscale. To reconnect, re-run tailscale up without any flags.

Available flags:

--accept-risk=<risk> Accept risk and skip confirmation for risk type. This can be either lose-ssh or all, or an empty string to not accept risk.

--reason="<description>" Specify the reason (inside quotes) for disconnecting Tailscale when the system policies AlwaysOn.Enabled and AlwaysOn.OverrideWithReason are enabled. For example, tailscale down --reason="DNS issues".

bugreport

The bugreport command is available in Tailscale v1.8 or later. If you don't see this command, consider updating your Tailscale client.

Generate a bug report with diagnostic information.

The bugreport command makes it easier to report bugs to the Tailscale team by marking diagnostic logs with indicators to make triage easier.

If you encounter a connectivity issue, run tailscale bugreport on the device experiencing the issue at the time you encounter it.

tailscale bugreport

This command prints a random identifier into diagnostic logs, which you can share with our team.

Identifiers look like this:

BUG-1b7641a16971a9cd75822c0ed8043fee70ae88cf05c52981dc220eb96a5c49a8-20210427151443Z-fbcd4fd3a4b7ad94

This command shares no personally identifiable information and is unused unless you share the bug identifier with our team.

Available flags:

--diagnose Prints additional verbose information about the system to the Tailscale logs after generating a bugreport identifier, which can then be viewed by our support team. Defaults to false.

--record Pause and then write another bugreport. Use this flag to create an initial bugreport identifier. During the pause, perform the action that reproduces your issue. Then, press Enter to create a second bugreport identifier. Share both bug identifiers with our team. Defaults to false.

cert

Generate Let's Encrypt certificate and key files on the host for HTTPS certificates in your tailnet.

If you are trying to serve a folder of files or reverse proxy to an HTTP service, use the tailscale serve command instead.

tailscale cert hostname.tails-scales.ts.net

Alternatively, if you want to save the certificate and private key to files, you can use the --cert-file and --key-file arguments:

tailscale cert --cert-file=cert.pem --key-file=key.pem hostname.tails-scales.ts.net

The certificates provided by Let's Encrypt have a 90-day expiry and require periodic renewal. When a certificate is delivered as files on disk which you then move to an install location, such as when using tailscale cert, the tailscaled daemon doesn't know where to place a renewed certificate or how to install it. As a result, you are responsible for renewing any certificates that you create using tailscale cert.

If a certificate is handled without the user initiating any file-based certificate installation (such as when using the Caddy integration of Tailscale) then the certificate will automatically renew without the user doing anything.

Available flags:

--cert-file=<cert> Specify the certificate output path.

--key-file=<key> Specify the private key output path.

--min-validity=<duration> Request a specified minimum remaining validity on the returned certificate. duration can be any value parseable by time.ParseDuration(). For example, use 120h to set the duration to five days.

--serve-demo Serve on port :443 using the cert as a demo, instead of writing out the files to disk.

The --min-validity flag lets you ensure that the returned certificate is valid for at least the specified duration. If you specify a duration longer than the certification lifetime set by Let's Encrypt, it uses the maximum lifetime set by Let's Encrypt.

dns

The dns command lets you access Tailscale DNS settings. It's available in Tailscale v1.74.0 and later.

Subcommands:

status Print the configuration of the local DNS forwarder and the tailnet-wide MagicDNS configuration.

query Perform a DNS query using the local DNS forwarder. It's available in Tailscale v1.76.0 and later.

logout

Disconnect from Tailscale and expire the current log in. The next time you run tailscale up, you'll need to reauthenticate your device.

tailscale logout

If you run tailscale logout on an ephemeral node, the node will be removed from your tailnet immediately.

Available flags:

--reason Reason for the logout, if required by a system policy.

metrics

Expose and collect Tailscale client metrics for use with third-party monitoring systems.

tailscale metrics

Subcommands:

netcheck

Get a report on your current physical network conditions. This command is provided to help debug connection troubles.

tailscale netcheck

netcheck will output a report like this:

Report:
* Time: 2025-03-13T16:35:03.336481Z
* UDP: true
* IPv4: yes, <ipv4-address>
* IPv6: yes, <ipv6-address>
* MappingVariesByDestIP: false
* PortMapping:
* Nearest DERP: Seattle
* DERP latency:
- sea: 24.2ms  (Seattle)
- sfo: 50.5ms  (San Francisco)
- lax: 57.2ms  (Los Angeles)
- den: 58.5ms  (Denver)
- dfw: 63ms    (Dallas)
- ord: 73.3ms  (Chicago)

(In the example output, the list of DERP servers is truncated for brevity.)

UDP shows whether UDP traffic is enabled on the current network. If this is false, it's unlikely Tailscale will be able to make point-to-point connections, and will instead rely on our encrypted TCP relays (DERP)

IPv4 and IPv6 show your network public IP addresses and support for both protocols.

MappingVariesByDestIP describes whether your device is behind a difficult NAT that varies the device's IP address depending on the destination.

HairPinning describes whether your router can route connections from endpoints on your LAN back to your LAN using those endpoints' globally-mapped IPv4 addresses/ports.

PortMapping describes a list of which three port-mapping services exist on your router. Possible values are "UPnP", "NAT-PMP", and "PCP".

DERP latency and Nearest DERP describe latency from our encrypted TCP relays (DERP). The lowest latency ("nearest") server is used for traffic.

If any fields are blank, it means Tailscale wasn't able to measure that network property.

All the information from tailscale netcheck is also available in the Machines page of the admin console, by selecting a particular machine.

Available flags:

--every=<duration> If non-zero, do an incremental report with the given frequency.

--format=<format> Output format; empty (for human-readable), json or json-line.

--verbose Verbose logs.

--bind-address Send and receive connectivity probes using this locally bound IP address.

--bind-port Send and receive connectivity probes using this UDP port.

nc

Connect to a port on a host, connected to stdin/stdout.

tailscale nc <hostname-or-IP> <port>

ping

Attempt to ping another device exclusively over Tailscale.

The regular ping command often works fine over Tailscale, but tailscale ping provides more details about the connection over Tailscale that can be helpful when troubleshooting connectivity.

tailscale ping <hostname-or-ip>

You can call tailscale ping using either a 100.x.y.z address or a machine name.

Available flags:

--c Maximum number of pings to send. Defaults to 10.

--icmp, --icmp=false Perform an ICMP-level ping (through WireGuard, but not the local host OS stack). Defaults to false.

--peerapi, --peerapi=false Try hitting the peer's PeerAPI HTTP server. Defaults to false.

--size=<size> Size of the ping message (default pings only). 0 for minimum size.

--tsmp, --tsmp=false Perform a TSMP-level ping (through WireGuard, but not either host's OS stack). Defaults to false.

--timeout=<duration> Maximum amount of time to wait before giving up on a ping. duration can be any value parseable by time.ParseDuration(). Defaults to 5s.

--until-direct, --until-direct=false Stop once a direct path is established. Defaults to true.

--verbose, --verbose=false Show verbose output. Defaults to false.

There are four types of ping messages supported by the tailscale ping command.

serve

Serve content and local servers from your Tailscale node to your tailnet.

To publicly share the local service to the internet, use the funnel command.

tailscale serve <target>
tailscale serve <subcommand> [flags] <args>

Subcommands:

status Gets the status.

reset Resets the configuration.

For more information, refer to the tailscale serve topic.

service

Interact with Tailscale Services from this node's perspective as a client.

A Tailscale Service is a virtual service with its own IP addresses. This command lists only the services that this node can access according to your tailnet's access policy.

tailscale service <subcommand>

Available subcommands:

list Lists the Tailscale Services this node can access.

The list subcommand prints a table with the following columns:

IP The Tailscale Service's Tailscale IP address.

HOSTNAME The Tailscale Service's MagicDNS hostname.

DISPLAY NAME The human-readable name of the Tailscale Service, if set.

ENDPOINTS The ports the service listens on.

TYPE The service's action types, such as http or ssh. If a service has no explicit action types, they are inferred from well-known ports.

The list subcommand outputs a table similar to the following:

IP                 HOSTNAME                           DISPLAY NAME     ENDPOINTS     TYPE
100.97.38.19       my-k8s.<tailnet>.ts.net            -                tcp:80        kubernetes

100.97.223.101     my-ssh.<tailnet>.ts.net            -                tcp:22        ssh
100.94.19.52       my-tcp.<tailnet>.ts.net            -                tcp:9000      tcp
100.94.254.78      my-vnc.<tailnet>.ts.net            -                tcp:5900      vnc

Available flags for list:

--json Output the list of Services in JSON format.

set

Change specified preferences.

Unlike tailscale up, this command does not require the complete set of desired settings. It only updates the settings you explicitly set. There are no default values. Note that when using Fast User Switching, changes made are only for the currently connected tailnet.

To show the current preference values, use the get command.

--webclient, --webclient=false Expose the web interface to your tailnet persistently in the background on port :5252.

ssh

Establish a Tailscale SSH session to a Tailscale machine.

You can often use the regular ssh command or another SSH client to make an SSH session to a Tailscale machine. However, when your local node is in userspace-networking mode and can't make a direct connection, use tailscale ssh. This sets up an SSH ProxyCommand to connect through the local tailscaled daemon. You can also use tailscale ssh when your local node is in kernel mode.

The tailscale ssh command automatically checks the destination server's SSH host key against the node's SSH host key as advertised by using the Tailscale coordination server.

tailscale ssh <args>

<args> is one of the following forms:

host The destination server. An interactive session will prompt you for the user name to use for the session.

user@host The user name for the session and the destination server.

For both forms, host can be the destination server's MagicDNS name (even if --accept-dns=false was set on the local node) or the destination server's Tailscale IP address.

tailscale ssh is not available on sandboxed macOS builds—use the regular ssh client instead.

status

Get the status of your connections to other Tailscale devices.

tailscale status

This command returns a condensed table of information in human-readable format:

1           2         3           4         5
100.1.2.3   device-a  apenwarr@   linux     active; direct <ip-port>, tx 1116 rx 1124
100.4.5.6   device-b  crawshaw@   macOS     active; relay <relay-server>, tx 1351 rx 4262
100.7.8.9   device-c  danderson@  windows   idle; tx 1214 rx 50
100.0.1.2   device-d  ross@       iOS       -

From left-to-right, these columns represent:

Column 1 is a Tailscale IP, which you can use to connect to the device.

Column 2 is the machine name of the device. If you use MagicDNS, you can also use this name to connect.

Column 3 is the email address for the owner of the device.

Column 4 is the device OS.

Column 5 shows the current connection status.

Connection status (column 5) is shown using three terms:

active means traffic is currently being sent/received from this device. It also includes the connection type, which can be direct, relay, or peer-relay.

If the connection is direct, it includes peer device's IP address.

If the connection is relay, it includes the DERP server's city code (nyc, fra, tok, syd) for the respective location.

If the connection is peer-relay, it includes the Tailscale IP address of the peer relay and the VNI (virtual network interface) used.

idle means traffic is not currently being sent/received from this device.

- means no traffic has ever been sent/received from this device.

active and idle connection statuses will also include tx/rx values indicating the number of bytes sent (tx) and received (rx) from this device.

Running tailscale status with the --json flag returns a machine-readable JSON response.

tailscale status --json

Unlike tailscale status, using this flag gives a detailed list of peers and users in your tailnet that makes it well-suited for automation tasks. It also includes additional metadata associated with your device.

Combine this with jq to automate data collection about your network. For example, the following command counts and sorts the relay servers your Tailscale peers are connected to.

tailscale status --json | jq -r '.Peer[].Relay | select(.!="")' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

Available flags:

--active Filter output to only peers with active sessions (not applicable to web mode).

--browser Open a browser in web mode (default true).

--header Show column headers in table format (default false).

--json Output in JSON format (WARNING: format subject to change).

--listen=<address> Listen address for web mode; use port 0 for automatic (default 127.0.0.1:8384).

--peers Show status of peers (default true).

--self Show status of local machine (default true).

--web Run webserver with HTML showing status.

switch

Switch to a different Tailscale account. For more information about switching accounts, refer to fast-user-switching.

tailscale switch <account> [flags]

Examples:

To switch to the alice@example.com account:

tailscale switch alice@example.com

To switch to the account that has the nickname "work":

tailscale switch work

Available flags:

--list Lists available accounts.

--json List available accounts in JSON format.

tailscale switch --list --json

Subcommands:

remove <id> removes a Tailscale account from the local machine. This does not delete the account itself, but it will no longer be available for switching to. You can add it back by logging in again. This command is currently in alpha and may change in the future.

syspolicy

List system policies, reload system policies, or inspect errors related to the system policies configured in your tailnet.

tailscale syspolicy

Subcommands:

list Shows system policies, reload system policies, or explore errors related to the system policies configured on the device.

reload Forces the Tailscale client to reload and reapply system policy settings on the device.

Available flags:

--json Return a machine-readable JSON response.

systray

The systray command is available on the Linux client, is currently in beta, and is available in Tailscale v1.88 or later.

Run the system tray (systray) application for Linux desktop clients to access some common actions like fast user switching and exit node selection.

tailscale systray

Do not run tailscale systray as superuser (sudo tailscale systray), because systray is not designed to run as superuser and the command will fail.

Available flags:

--theme=<color-option> Color theme for Tailscale icon: dark, dark:nobg, light, light:nobg.

update

The update command is available in Tailscale v1.36 or later for Windows and Ubuntu/Debian Linux, in v1.48.0 or later for the Mac Apple Store version and Synology, and in v1.54.0 or later for QNAP and the Standalone variant of the macOS application. If you don't see this command and you are running one of these operating systems, consider updating your Tailscale client.

Update the Tailscale client version to the latest version, or to a different version.

tailscale update [flags]

Available flags:

--dry-run Show what update would do, without performing the update and without prompting to start the update.

--track The track to check for updates, either "stable", "release-candidate", or unstable. If not specified, the update uses the track currently in effect for the client. For more information, refer to Tailscale client versions and release tracks.

--version An explicit version to use for the update or downgrade. You cannot specify both --track and --version. This flag is not available on the macOS client.

--yes Perform the update without interactive prompts. Defaults to false.

If you downgrade to a version that does not have the tailscale update functionality, you won't be able to run tailscale update to return to the prior version. You would need to perform an update without using the Tailscale CLI.

To determine the current version on a client, run tailscale version.

Examples:

Update to the latest version within your current track (stable or unstable, depending on what you're running):

tailscale update

Update to the latest version within your current track without using interactive prompts:

tailscale update --yes

Update to Tailscale v1.34:

tailscale update --version=1.34.0

Update to the latest unstable version:

tailscale update --track=unstable

version

Print the version of Tailscale.

tailscale version [flags]

Available flags:

--daemon Also print local node's daemon version. Defaults to false.

--json Return a machine-readable JSON response.

--upstream Print the latest upstream release version from pkgs.tailscale.com. Defaults to false.

--track, --track=[stable|unstable|release-candidate] Check a specified track for updates. Empty value is the current track. For more information, refer to Tailscale client versions and release tracks.

Running tailscale version also prints other information, including the Go version. Here's an example of the output:

tailscale version
1.72.0
tailscale commit: 9a0f00ea8ed08d1a94b357fb232ac9d44a512664
other commit: 387e0b40ad87031fb4444372ee80a97156e8deb9
go version: go1.22.5

wait

Wait for Tailscale resources to become available for binding within a specified timeout or indefinitely.

The command returns exit code 0 on success. It returns a non-zero exit code on failure or timeout.

As of Tailscale version 1.96, the only resource available to wait for is the Tailscale interface and its IPs. A future version of this command may support waiting for other types of resources.
If running in userspace-networking mode, this command only waits for tailscaled and the Running state, as no physical network interface exists.

tailscale wait [flags]

Available flags:

--timeout=<duration> Set a timeout duration in seconds. Setting the duration to 0 will set the timeout to indefinite.

Examples:

To wait on a specific type of IP address, use tailscale ip in combination with the tailscale wait command. For example, to wait for an IPv4 address:

tailscale wait && tailscale ip --assert=<specific-ip-address>

Linux systemd users can wait for the tailscale-online.target target, which runs this command.

A service that wants to bind to (listen on) a Tailscale interface or IP address, can use the following pattern to ensure Tailscale is ready before the program starts:

tailscale wait && /path/to/service [...]

web

Start a web server for controlling the tailscaled daemon. Starting a web server is useful when the CLI or a native app is impractical (such as on NAS devices).

tailscale web [flags]

Available flags:

--cgi=<true|false> Run the web server as a CGI script. Defaults to false.

--listen=<ip|name> Set the listen address. Use port 0 for automatic. Defaults to localhost:8088.

--origin=<hostname> Origin at which the web UI is served (if behind a reverse proxy or used with CGI).

--prefix=<string> Set the URL prefix added to requests (for CGI or reverse proxies).

--readonly Run the web server in read-only mode.

whoami

Get the machine and user identity of the current machine.

This is equivalent to running tailscale whois on one of the current machine's own Tailscale IP addresses.

tailscale whoami [--json]

Available flags:

--json Output in JSON format.

whois

Get the machine and user associated with a Tailscale IP.

tailscale whois ip[:port]

For user devices, this command returns:

Machine:
Name:
ID:
Addresses:
AllowedIPs:
User:
Name:
ID:
Capabilities:

For devices that are tagged, this command returns:

Machine:
Name:
ID:
Addresses:
AllowedIPs:
Tags:
Capabilities:

For each of these fields:

Machine, Name is the machine name of the device. If you use MagicDNS, you can also use this name to connect.

Machine, ID is the node id of the device.

Machine, Addresses are the Tailscale IP, which you can use to connect to the device.

Machine, AllowedIPs are the subnet routes available to the device.

Machine, Tags are the tags to which the device belongs.

User, Name is the email address for the owner of the device.

User, ID is the unique ID of the user

Capabilities show the grants for the device.

Running tailscale whois with the --json flag will return a machine-readable JSON response. (Note that the --json option must come before the ip[:port] argument.)

tailscale whois --json ip[:port]

Available flags:

--json Output in JSON format.

--proto=<proto> Protocol for the WhoIs request; one of tcp or udp; empty means both.

appc-routes

Print the current app connector route status.

By default this command prints the domains configured in the app connector
configuration and how many routes have been learned for each domain.

tailscale appc-routes [flags]

Available flags:

--all Print learned domains and routes and extra policy configured routes.

--map Print the map of learned domains.

--n Print the total number of routes this node advertises.
